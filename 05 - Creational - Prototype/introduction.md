# Prototype Pattern

## üìñ What is the Prototype Pattern?

The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing instances (prototypes) rather than creating new objects from scratch. Instead of depending on classes to create objects, the pattern relies on copying or cloning existing objects to produce new instances.

## üéØ Intent

**Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.**

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

The Prototype pattern typically involves several key components:

### 1. **Prototype Interface**
- Declares the cloning interface common to all prototypes
- Usually contains a `clone()` method
- May include additional methods for prototype management

### 2. **Concrete Prototype**
- Implements the cloning interface
- Defines how to clone itself (deep vs shallow copy)
- Maintains its own state and data

### 3. **Client**
- Creates new objects by requesting clones from prototypes
- May maintain a registry of prototypes
- Configures cloned objects as needed

### 4. **Prototype Registry (Optional)**
- Maintains a collection of available prototypes
- Provides factory-like interface for prototype access
- Manages prototype lifecycle and variations

## üí° Key Characteristics

### **Object Cloning**
- Creates new instances by copying existing ones
- Supports both shallow and deep copying strategies
- Preserves object state and configuration during cloning

### **Runtime Configuration**
- Objects are created based on runtime decisions
- No need to know specific classes at compile time
- Dynamic object creation based on available prototypes

### **Reduced Subclassing**
- Avoids complex class hierarchies for object creation
- Uses composition and cloning instead of inheritance
- Simplifies object creation when many variations exist

### **Performance Benefits**
- Faster than creating objects from scratch
- Useful when object initialization is expensive
- Reuses existing object state and configuration

## ‚úÖ Benefits

### **1. Flexible Object Creation**
- Create objects without knowing their exact classes
- Add and remove prototypes at runtime
- Configure objects by cloning and modifying

### **2. Reduced Object Creation Cost**
```typescript
// Instead of expensive initialization every time
const expensiveObject = new ComplexObject();
expensiveObject.loadLargeDataset();
expensiveObject.performComplexCalculations();

// Clone pre-initialized prototype
const quickObject = expensivePrototype.clone();
```

### **3. Dynamic Product Configuration**
- Change object types at runtime
- Support for parameterized object creation
- Easy variation management through prototype registry

### **4. Simplified Client Code**
- Clients don't need to know about concrete classes
- Uniform interface for object creation
- Reduced coupling between client and product classes

### **5. Avoiding Complex Class Hierarchies**
- No need for parallel class hierarchies
- Composition over inheritance approach
- Easier maintenance and extension

### **6. Configurable Object Templates**
- Pre-configured objects serve as templates
- Easy customization through cloning and modification
- Support for default configurations and variations

## ‚ùå Drawbacks

### **1. Complex Cloning Logic**
- Deep copying can be challenging to implement correctly
- Circular references require special handling
- Performance overhead of copying large object graphs

### **2. Clone Method Maintenance**
- Every prototype class needs proper clone implementation
- Changes to class structure require clone method updates
- Risk of shallow vs deep copy bugs

### **3. Not Suitable for All Objects**
- Objects with unique identities shouldn't be cloned
- Singleton objects violate prototype pattern principles
- Database connections and external resources need special handling

### **4. Memory Usage**
- Prototype registry may consume significant memory
- Multiple prototype instances for variations
- Potential memory leaks if prototypes aren't managed properly

## ‚ö° When to Use Prototype Pattern

### **‚úÖ Use Prototype When:**

1. **Expensive Object Creation**
   - Object initialization involves costly operations
   - Database queries, file I/O, or network calls during construction
   - Complex calculations or data processing required

2. **Dynamic Object Types**
   - Object types determined at runtime
   - Need to create objects without knowing exact classes
   - Configuration-driven object creation

3. **Many Object Variations**
   - Similar objects with slight differences
   - Avoiding large class hierarchies
   - Template-based object creation

4. **Framework or Library Development**
   - Providing extensible object creation mechanisms
   - Plugin architectures with dynamic object types
   - Generic object factories

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Default configurations that can be customized
   - Environment-specific object templates
   - User preference-based object creation

### **‚ùå Avoid Prototype When:**

1. **Simple Object Creation**
   - Object creation is fast and inexpensive
   - No complex initialization required
   - Standard constructors are sufficient

2. **Unique Object Identity Required**
   - Objects need unique identities or IDs
   - Singleton pattern is more appropriate
   - Object represents unique resources

3. **Immutable Objects**
   - Objects never change after creation
   - No benefit from cloning vs. creation
   - Value objects or data transfer objects

## üîÑ Prototype vs Other Patterns

### **Prototype vs Factory Method**
- **Prototype**: Clones existing objects
- **Factory Method**: Creates new objects from scratch

### **Prototype vs Abstract Factory**
- **Prototype**: Uses cloning for object creation
- **Abstract Factory**: Uses class instantiation for families of objects

### **Prototype vs Builder**
- **Prototype**: Clones and modifies existing objects
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step

### **Prototype vs Singleton**
- **Prototype**: Encourages object copying
- **Singleton**: Prevents object duplication

## üìä Pattern Variations

### **1. Registry-Based Prototype**
```typescript
class PrototypeRegistry {
  private prototypes = new Map<string, Prototype>();
  
  register(name: string, prototype: Prototype): void {
    this.prototypes.set(name, prototype);
  }
  
  create(name: string): Prototype {
    const prototype = this.prototypes.get(name);
    return prototype ? prototype.clone() : null;
  }
}
```

### **2. Shallow vs Deep Cloning**
```typescript
class ShallowClone implements Prototype {
  clone(): this {
    return Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)), this);
  }
}

class DeepClone implements Prototype {
  clone(): this {
    return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this)); // Simple deep clone
  }
}
```

### **3. Parameterized Prototypes**
```typescript
class ParameterizedPrototype {
  clone(parameters: any): this {
    const cloned = this.basicClone();
    Object.assign(cloned, parameters);
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

### **4. Hierarchical Prototypes**
```typescript
class HierarchicalPrototype {
  protected children: Prototype[] = [];
  
  clone(): this {
    const cloned = this.shallowClone();
    cloned.children = this.children.map(child => child.clone());
    return cloned;
  }
}
```

## üé® Implementation Strategies

### **Cloning Approaches**
1. **Shallow Copy**: Copy object properties, share referenced objects
2. **Deep Copy**: Recursively copy all objects and nested structures
3. **Custom Copy**: Application-specific copying logic for special cases

### **Registry Management**
1. **Static Registry**: Compile-time prototype registration
2. **Dynamic Registry**: Runtime prototype registration and management
3. **Hierarchical Registry**: Nested registries for organized prototype management

### **Memory Management**
1. **Lazy Cloning**: Clone objects only when needed
2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse cloned objects to reduce allocation
3. **Prototype Cleanup**: Remove unused prototypes to prevent memory leaks

## üöÄ Modern TypeScript Features

### **Generic Prototypes**
```typescript
interface Prototype<T> {
  clone(): T;
}

class GenericPrototype<T> implements Prototype<T> {
  clone(): T {
    return Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)), this);
  }
}
```

### **Type-Safe Cloning**
```typescript
type CloneableProperties<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K] extends Function ? never : T[K];
};

class TypeSafePrototype<T> {
  clone(): Pick<T, keyof CloneableProperties<T>> {
    // Implementation with type safety
  }
}
```

### **Decorator-Based Cloning**
```typescript
function Cloneable<T extends new (...args: any[]) => {}>(constructor: T) {
  return class extends constructor implements Prototype<T> {
    clone(): T {
      return Object.assign(Object.create(Object.getPrototypeOf(this)), this);
    }
  };
}

@Cloneable
class MyClass {
  // Class implementation
}
```
