# Visitor Pattern - Use Cases

## Overview

The Visitor pattern is essential for separating algorithms from the object structures they operate on. It's particularly valuable in scenarios where you have a complex object structure with many different operations, and you want to add new operations without modifying existing classes. This pattern is widely used in compiler design, document processing, graphics systems, and any system that requires operations on heterogeneous object structures.

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Problem | Solution | Demo File |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Document Processing** | Different operations on document elements without modifying element classes | Visitor pattern separates export, print, and validation operations | `use-case-document-processing.ts` |
| **AST Compiler** | Multiple operations on abstract syntax tree nodes (analysis, optimization, codegen) | Visitor pattern handles different operations on AST nodes | `use-case-ast-compiler.ts` |
| **Graphics System** | Operations on graphic objects (render, serialize, transform) without changing object classes | Visitor pattern encapsulates graphic operations | `use-case-graphics-system.ts` |
| **File System Operations** | Operations on file system objects (backup, search, permissions) | Visitor pattern handles file system operations | `use-case-file-system.ts` |
| **Game Engine** | Operations on game objects (update, render, serialize) | Visitor pattern manages game object operations | `use-case-game-engine.ts` |
| **Configuration System** | Operations on configuration objects (validate, export, migrate) | Visitor pattern handles configuration operations | `use-case-configuration-system.ts` |

## Use Case 1: Document Processing

### Problem
A document processing system has different types of elements (paragraphs, images, tables) and needs to support multiple operations (export to PDF, print, validate, count words). Adding new operations directly to element classes would violate the Single Responsibility Principle and make the classes bloated.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern separates operations from element classes. Each operation becomes a visitor (PDFExporter, Printer, Validator, WordCounter) that implements visit methods for each element type. Elements implement an accept method that calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor.

**Target Interface**: `DocumentElement` with `accept(visitor: DocumentVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitParagraph()`, `visitImage()`, `visitTable()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `PDFExporter`, `Printer`, `Validator`, `WordCounter`

## Use Case 2: AST Compiler

### Problem
A compiler needs to perform multiple operations on abstract syntax tree nodes (syntax analysis, optimization, code generation, type checking). Each operation requires different logic for different node types, and adding new operations should not require modifying existing AST node classes.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern allows each operation to be implemented as a separate visitor class. AST nodes implement an accept method that calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor, enabling double dispatch to select the correct operation for each node type.

**Target Interface**: `ASTNode` with `accept(visitor: ASTVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitExpression()`, `visitStatement()`, `visitDeclaration()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `SyntaxAnalyzer`, `Optimizer`, `CodeGenerator`, `TypeChecker`

## Use Case 3: Graphics System

### Problem
A graphics system contains different types of shapes (circles, rectangles, lines) and needs to support various operations (rendering, serialization, transformation, bounding box calculation). Adding these operations directly to shape classes would create bloated, hard-to-maintain code.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern encapsulates graphics operations in separate visitor classes. Each shape type implements an accept method that calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor, allowing operations to be added without modifying shape classes.

**Target Interface**: `Shape` with `accept(visitor: GraphicsVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitCircle()`, `visitRectangle()`, `visitLine()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `Renderer`, `Serializer`, `Transformer`, `BoundingBoxCalculator`

## Use Case 4: File System Operations

### Problem
A file system contains different types of objects (files, directories, symbolic links) and needs to support various operations (backup, search, permission management, size calculation). Implementing these operations directly in file system classes would violate the Open/Closed Principle.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern separates file system operations from the objects they operate on. Each operation becomes a visitor that implements visit methods for each file system object type, allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing classes.

**Target Interface**: `FileSystemObject` with `accept(visitor: FileSystemVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitFile()`, `visitDirectory()`, `visitSymbolicLink()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `BackupVisitor`, `SearchVisitor`, `PermissionVisitor`, `SizeCalculator`

## Use Case 5: Game Engine

### Problem
A game engine contains different types of game objects (players, enemies, items, obstacles) and needs to support various operations (update, render, serialize, collision detection). Adding these operations directly to game object classes would create complex, tightly coupled code.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern encapsulates game operations in separate visitor classes. Each game object type implements an accept method that calls the appropriate visit method on the visitor, enabling clean separation of concerns and easy addition of new operations.

**Target Interface**: `GameObject` with `accept(visitor: GameVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitPlayer()`, `visitEnemy()`, `visitItem()`, `visitObstacle()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `UpdateVisitor`, `RenderVisitor`, `SerializeVisitor`, `CollisionVisitor`

## Use Case 6: Configuration System

### Problem
A configuration system contains different types of configuration objects (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects) and needs to support various operations (validation, export, migration, documentation generation). Implementing these operations directly in configuration classes would create maintenance issues.

### Solution
The Visitor pattern separates configuration operations from the objects they operate on. Each operation becomes a visitor that implements visit methods for each configuration type, allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing configuration classes.

**Target Interface**: `ConfigValue` with `accept(visitor: ConfigVisitor)` method  
**Visitor Operations**: `visitString()`, `visitNumber()`, `visitBoolean()`, `visitArray()`, `visitObject()`  
**Concrete Visitors**: `Validator`, `Exporter`, `Migrator`, `DocumentationGenerator`

## Best Practices / Anti-Patterns

### Best Practices
- **Plan for Extensibility**: Design visitor interfaces to accommodate future element types
- **Maintain Encapsulation**: Avoid breaking encapsulation by accessing private element members
- **Use Stateful Visitors**: Consider using visitors with state for complex operations
- **Group Related Operations**: Keep related operations together in visitor classes
- **Consider Performance**: Be aware of double dispatch overhead in performance-critical scenarios
- **Test Independently**: Test each visitor independently with different element types

### Anti-Patterns
- **Visitor Explosion**: Creating too many visitor classes for simple operations
- **Breaking Encapsulation**: Visitors accessing private element members directly
- **Tight Coupling**: Visitors knowing too much about element implementation details
- **Performance Issues**: Using visitors for simple operations that don't need separation
- **Complexity Overhead**: Using visitors when simpler patterns would suffice
- **Maintenance Burden**: Not updating all visitors when adding new element types
- **Circular Dependencies**: Creating circular dependencies between visitors and elements
