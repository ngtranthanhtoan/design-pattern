# Command Pattern Use Cases

## Overview

The Command pattern is essential for building flexible, extensible systems where operations need to be encapsulated, queued, or undone. It's particularly valuable in user interfaces, game development, and business applications where user actions need to be tracked and potentially reversed.

## Use Case 1: Text Editor Operations

### Problem
A text editor needs to support various operations like copy, paste, cut, and undo/redo functionality. Each operation should be trackable and reversible.

### Solution
Implement each operation as a command object that encapsulates the action and stores the necessary state for undo operations.

**Target Interface**: `Command` with `execute()` and `undo()` methods  
**Key Commands**: `CopyCommand`, `PasteCommand`, `CutCommand`, `DeleteCommand`  
**Demo**: `npm run command:text-editor`

## Use Case 2: Smart Home Automation

### Problem
A smart home system needs to control various devices (lights, thermostat, security) through different interfaces (mobile app, voice commands, scheduled events).

### Solution
Each device action is encapsulated as a command, allowing the system to queue, schedule, and execute operations uniformly.

**Target Interface**: `DeviceCommand` with device-specific execution logic  
**Key Commands**: `LightCommand`, `ThermostatCommand`, `SecurityCommand`  
**Demo**: `npm run command:smart-home`

## Use Case 3: Restaurant Order System

### Problem
A restaurant needs to process orders from multiple sources (dine-in, takeout, delivery) with different preparation workflows and the ability to modify or cancel orders.

### Solution
Each order item becomes a command that can be queued, modified, or cancelled, with the kitchen staff as the receivers.

**Target Interface**: `OrderCommand` with preparation and cancellation logic  
**Key Commands**: `CookingCommand`, `PreparationCommand`, `DeliveryCommand`  
**Demo**: `npm run command:restaurant`

## Use Case 4: Game Input Handling

### Problem
A game needs to handle player input from multiple sources (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) and support input recording, replay, and network synchronization.

### Solution
Player actions are encapsulated as commands that can be recorded, replayed, and synchronized across the network.

**Target Interface**: `GameCommand` with serialization for network transmission  
**Key Commands**: `MoveCommand`, `ActionCommand`, `MenuCommand`  
**Demo**: `npm run command:game-input`

## Use Case 5: Database Transaction Manager

### Problem
A database system needs to support complex transactions that can be committed, rolled back, and logged for audit purposes.

### Solution
Each database operation is a command that can be executed, undone, and logged as part of a transaction.

**Target Interface**: `TransactionCommand` with commit and rollback capabilities  
**Key Commands**: `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, `DeleteCommand`  
**Demo**: `npm run command:database`

## Best Practices

- **Keep Commands Lightweight**: Store only essential state, not entire objects
- **Implement Proper Undo**: Always consider how to reverse each command
- **Use Macro Commands**: Combine related commands for complex operations
- **Log Command Execution**: Maintain audit trails for debugging and compliance
- **Handle Command Failures**: Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms

## Anti-Patterns

- **Command Explosion**: Creating too many command classes for simple operations
- **Heavy Commands**: Storing too much state or performing complex logic in commands
- **Tight Coupling**: Making commands too dependent on specific receiver implementations
- **Over-Engineering**: Using commands when simple function calls would suffice
