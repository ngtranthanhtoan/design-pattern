# Memento Pattern Use Cases

## Overview

The Memento pattern is essential for implementing undo/redo functionality and state restoration in applications. It's particularly valuable in systems where users need to revert changes, applications need to maintain state history, or systems require checkpoint/rollback capabilities.

## Use Case 1: Text Editor Undo/Redo System

### Problem
A text editor needs to provide undo and redo functionality for text changes, allowing users to revert their edits and restore previous versions of their document without losing the ability to redo changes.

### Solution
Implement a memento-based undo/redo system where each text change creates a memento of the document state, enabling users to navigate through their editing history.

**Target Interface**: `TextEditor` with `saveState()`, `undo()`, and `redo()` methods  
**Key Features**: 
- Document state snapshots with cursor position and selection
- Unlimited undo/redo history with memory management
- Text content, formatting, and metadata preservation
- Cursor position and selection state restoration
- Memory-efficient state storage with compression
- Real-time state saving on significant changes

**Demo**: `npm run memento:text-editor`

## Use Case 2: Graphics Application Drawing History

### Problem
A graphics application needs to maintain a history of drawing operations, allowing users to undo brush strokes, shape additions, and layer modifications while preserving the ability to redo these operations.

### Solution
Create a memento system that captures the complete canvas state after each drawing operation, enabling precise restoration of the artwork at any point in the editing history.

**Target Interface**: `Canvas` with `saveState()`, `undo()`, and `redo()` methods  
**Key Features**: 
- Canvas state snapshots with all layers and objects
- Drawing operation history with timestamps
- Layer visibility and opacity state preservation
- Brush settings and tool state restoration
- Memory-optimized state storage for large canvases
- Selective state saving for performance optimization

**Demo**: `npm run memento:graphics`

## Use Case 3: Database Transaction Rollback

### Problem
A database system needs to provide transaction rollback capabilities, allowing operations to be undone if they fail or if the user decides to cancel the transaction.

### Solution
Implement a memento system that captures the database state before each transaction, enabling complete rollback to the pre-transaction state.

**Target Interface**: `DatabaseTransaction` with `begin()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()` methods  
**Key Features**: 
- Pre-transaction state snapshots
- Multi-table state preservation
- Index and constraint state management
- Connection state and lock management
- Partial rollback support for complex transactions
- Memory-efficient state storage for large datasets

**Demo**: `npm run memento:database`

## Use Case 4: Game Save System

### Problem
A video game needs to save and load game states, allowing players to resume their progress from any point and enabling features like quick save/load and checkpoint systems.

### Solution
Create a memento-based save system that captures the complete game state, including player position, inventory, world state, and game progress.

**Target Interface**: `GameState` with `save()`, `load()`, and `checkpoint()` methods  
**Key Features**: 
- Complete game world state preservation
- Player statistics and inventory state
- NPC positions and AI state management
- World events and quest progress tracking
- Compressed state storage for large game worlds
- Multiple save slots with metadata

**Demo**: `npm run memento:game`

## Use Case 5: Configuration Management System

### Problem
A configuration management system needs to track changes to application settings, allowing administrators to revert to previous configurations and maintain a history of configuration changes.

### Solution
Implement a memento system that captures configuration states before each change, enabling administrators to rollback to previous configurations and track configuration history.

**Target Interface**: `ConfigurationManager` with `saveState()`, `restore()`, and `getHistory()` methods  
**Key Features**: 
- Configuration state snapshots with timestamps
- User and change reason tracking
- Environment-specific configuration preservation
- Dependency and validation state management
- Configuration diff generation and display
- Automated backup and restore scheduling

**Demo**: `npm run memento:configuration`

## Best Practices

- **Immutable Mementos**: Ensure mementos cannot be modified after creation
- **Memory Management**: Implement limits and cleanup for memento history
- **Selective State Saving**: Only save necessary state to optimize performance
- **Error Handling**: Provide graceful handling of state restoration failures
- **Thread Safety**: Consider concurrent access when implementing memento systems

## Anti-Patterns

- **God Memento**: Storing excessive state in a single memento
- **Mutable State**: Allowing mementos to be modified after creation
- **Memory Leaks**: Not cleaning up old mementos
- **Deep Copy Overhead**: Unnecessarily copying large object graphs
- **State Synchronization**: Failing to keep mementos synchronized with originator
