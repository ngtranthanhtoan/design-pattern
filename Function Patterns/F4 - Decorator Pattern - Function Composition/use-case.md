# Use Case: HTTP Middleware Pipeline

## Problem Statement

Modern web applications need flexible request/response processing pipelines with:
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Request logging and monitoring
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Response transformation and caching
- Error handling and recovery
- Cross-cutting concerns like CORS, compression, and security headers

Traditional middleware approaches often involve:
- Complex class hierarchies and inheritance
- Mutable request/response objects
- Difficult testing and composition
- Tight coupling between middleware components
- Hard-to-debug middleware chains

## Solution: Function Composition Middleware

Using functional decorators, we can create a clean middleware pipeline where:
- Each middleware is a pure higher-order function
- Request/response objects remain immutable
- Middleware can be easily composed and reordered
- Individual middleware components are easily testable
- The pipeline is type-safe and self-documenting

## Implementation Highlights

### Key Features

1. **Immutable Pipeline**: Each middleware creates new request/response objects
2. **Composable Architecture**: Easy to add, remove, or reorder middleware
3. **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper type inference
4. **Pure Functions**: No side effects, predictable behavior
5. **Easy Testing**: Individual middleware can be tested in isolation
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful error propagation through the pipeline
7. **Performance**: Optimized function composition with minimal overhead

### Core Components

1. **Request/Response Types**: Immutable data structures for HTTP communication
2. **Middleware Functions**: Higher-order functions that enhance request processing
3. **Pipeline Composer**: Function composition utilities for chaining middleware
4. **Error Handling**: Type-safe error propagation and recovery
5. **Conditional Middleware**: Dynamic middleware application based on conditions
6. **Async Support**: Full support for asynchronous middleware operations

### Real-World Applications

- **API Gateway**: Request routing and transformation
- **Authentication Services**: JWT token validation and user context
- **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and quota management
- **Logging Services**: Request/response logging and monitoring
- **Content Delivery**: Response caching and compression
- **Security Services**: Input validation and security headers

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Maintainability**: Easy to add, remove, or modify middleware
2. **Testability**: Each middleware function can be tested independently
3. **Composability**: Flexible pipeline construction and reordering
4. **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees about middleware compatibility
5. **Performance**: Efficient function composition with minimal overhead
6. **Debugging**: Clear, traceable middleware execution flow
7. **Reusability**: Middleware functions can be reused across different applications

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Define middleware functions
const withAuth = createAuthMiddleware({ secret: 'jwt-secret' });
const withLogging = createLoggingMiddleware({ level: 'info' });
const withCors = createCorsMiddleware({ origin: '*' });
const withRateLimit = createRateLimitMiddleware({ maxRequests: 100 });

// Compose middleware pipeline
const pipeline = pipe(
  withLogging,
  withCors,
  withAuth,
  withRateLimit
);

// Apply to request handler
const enhancedHandler = pipeline(baseHandler);

// Process request
const response = await enhancedHandler(request);
```

This use case demonstrates how functional composition can create a more maintainable and flexible middleware system compared to traditional class-based approaches, with better type safety and easier testing.
