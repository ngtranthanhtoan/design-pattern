# Abstract Factory Pattern

## What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?

The Abstract Factory pattern is a **creational design pattern** that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's essentially a factory of factories, where each factory produces a complete set of related products that work together.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Family Creation**: Creates families of related objects that are designed to work together
2. **Interface-Based**: Uses abstract interfaces for both factories and products
3. **Consistency**: Ensures products from the same family are compatible
4. **Isolation**: Client code is isolated from concrete product classes
5. **Interchangeability**: Easy to switch between different product families

## How it Works

The Abstract Factory pattern defines abstract factories that create abstract products. Concrete factories implement these interfaces to create concrete products that belong to the same family:

- **Abstract Factory**: Interface declaring creation methods for abstract products
- **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory to create specific product families
- **Abstract Product**: Interface for a type of product object
- **Concrete Product**: Specific implementations of abstract products
- **Client**: Uses only abstract factories and products

## Structure

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ AbstractFactory │    │ AbstractProduct │    │ AbstractProduct │
├─────────────────┤    │       A         │    │       B         │
│ + createProductA│◇───┤ + operation()   │    │ + operation()   │
│ + createProductB│    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
└─────────────────┘             △                       △
        △                       │                       │
        │                       │                       │
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ ConcreteFactory1│    │ ConcreteProductA1│   │ ConcreteProductB1│
├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤
│ + createProductA│────│ + operation()   │    │ + operation()   │
│ + createProductB│────│                 │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensures products from the same family work together
- **Isolation**: Isolates client code from concrete product classes
- **Easy Switching**: Simple to switch between different product families
- **Single Responsibility**: Each factory is responsible for one product family
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Easy to add new product families
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

## Drawbacks

- **Complexity**: Can be overkill for simple object creation
- **Rigid Structure**: Adding new product types requires changing all factory interfaces
- **Interface Explosion**: Can lead to many interfaces and classes
- **Learning Curve**: More complex than simpler factory patterns

## When to Use

✅ **Use Abstract Factory when:**
- You need to create families of related products that must work together
- Your system should be independent of how its products are created
- You want to provide a library of products that reveals only interfaces
- You need to configure your system with one of multiple families of products
- Related products are designed to be used together and you want to enforce this constraint

❌ **Don't use when:**
- You only need to create single, unrelated objects
- Product families are not related or don't need to work together
- The added complexity isn't justified by the benefits
- You have simple object creation needs
- Products don't vary in families

## Comparison with Factory Method

| Aspect | Factory Method | Abstract Factory |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Creates one product | Creates families of products |
| **Structure** | One factory method | Multiple factory methods |
| **Products** | Single product hierarchy | Multiple product hierarchies |
| **Complexity** | Simpler | More complex |
| **Use Case** | Single object creation | Related object families |

## Real-World Examples

- **GUI Frameworks**: Creating UI elements for different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Database Drivers**: Creating connections, commands, and readers for different databases
- **Gaming Engines**: Creating graphics, audio, and input components for different platforms
- **Document Processors**: Creating parsers, formatters, and exporters for different formats
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Creating payment, shipping, and tax components for different regions

## Related Patterns

- **Factory Method**: Abstract Factory often uses Factory Methods to create products
- **Singleton**: Abstract Factory is often implemented as a Singleton
- **Prototype**: Can use Prototype pattern to create product families
- **Builder**: Both are concerned with creating complex objects
- **Bridge**: Both separate abstraction from implementation

## Common Implementation Variations

### 1. **Parameterized Factory**
```typescript
// Factory creates products based on parameters
factory.createProduct('button', { theme: 'dark', size: 'large' });
```

### 2. **Registry-Based Factory**
```typescript
// Factories register themselves for different types
FactoryRegistry.register('windows', new WindowsUIFactory());
```

### 3. **Configuration-Driven Factory**
```typescript
// Factory selection based on configuration
const factory = AbstractFactory.fromConfig(appConfig);
```

### 4. **Hierarchical Factories**
```typescript
// Nested factory structures for complex product families
const uiFactory = createUIFactory(platform);
const componentFactory = uiFactory.createComponentFactory(theme);
```

The Abstract Factory pattern is particularly powerful when you need to ensure that related objects work together and want to provide flexibility in switching between different families of products while maintaining consistency and compatibility within each family.
