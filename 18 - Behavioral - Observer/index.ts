console.log('=== OBSERVER PATTERN ===\n');

console.log('üìö Overview:');
console.log('The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that');
console.log('when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers)');
console.log('are notified and updated automatically. It enables loose coupling between');
console.log('the subject and its observers, allowing for dynamic subscription and unsubscription.\n');

console.log('üéØ Key Participants:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Subject: Maintains a list of observers and notifies them of state changes');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Observer: Defines an interface for objects that should be notified of changes');
console.log('‚Ä¢ ConcreteSubject: Stores state of interest and sends notifications');
console.log('‚Ä¢ ConcreteObserver: Implements the Observer interface and maintains a reference to a Subject\n');

console.log('üí° Use Cases:');
console.log('1. Stock Market System - Real-time price updates to traders');
console.log('2. Social Media Feed - Notifying followers of new posts');
console.log('3. Logging System - Multi-destination event logging');
console.log('4. Weather Station - Multiple displays showing weather data');
console.log('5. Game Engine - UI components updating with game state changes\n');

console.log('üöÄ Available Demos:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ npm run observer:stock-market    - Stock trading system with real-time updates');
console.log('‚Ä¢ npm run observer:social-media    - Social media feed with notifications');
console.log('‚Ä¢ npm run observer:logging         - Multi-destination logging system');
console.log('‚Ä¢ npm run observer:weather         - Weather station with multiple displays');
console.log('‚Ä¢ npm run observer:game-engine     - Game engine with UI component updates\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Benefits:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Loose coupling between subject and observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Easy to add new observers without modifying existing code');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Natural fit for event-driven architectures');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Enables real-time data synchronization');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Clear separation of concerns\n');

console.log('‚ùå Drawbacks:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Memory leaks if observers are not properly unsubscribed');
console.log('‚Ä¢ No guarantee of notification order across observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Can cause performance issues with many observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Hard to debug when many observers are involved');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Risk of tight coupling if observers know too much about subjects\n');

console.log('üîó Related Patterns:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Mediator: Can use Observer to notify components about mediator events');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Command: Commands can use Observer to notify about execution status');
console.log('‚Ä¢ State: State changes can notify observers about state transitions');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Chain of Responsibility: Can combine with Observer for event propagation');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Event Sourcing: Observer pattern is fundamental to event sourcing architectures\n');

console.log('üéÆ Implementation Variations:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Push vs Pull Models - Subject sends data vs Observer requests data');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Event-Based Observers - Type-specific event handling');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Async Observers - Asynchronous notification processing');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Observer with Filtering - Selective notification based on criteria\n');

console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è  Common Pitfalls:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Observer Explosion - Too many observers causing performance issues');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Circular Dependencies - Observers updating subjects causing infinite loops');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Memory Leaks - Forgetting to unsubscribe observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Update Storms - Cascading updates between multiple subjects and observers\n');

console.log('üîß Best Practices:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Always provide unsubscribe mechanisms to prevent memory leaks');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Handle observer exceptions to prevent cascading failures');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use efficient data structures for observer management');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Consider thread safety for multi-threaded environments');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use mock observers for unit testing subjects\n');

console.log('üìä Performance Considerations:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use efficient data structures (Set/Map) for observer management');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Consider batching notifications for high-frequency updates');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use weak references for observers that might be garbage collected');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Profile memory usage with large numbers of observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Consider using event loops for async observer processing\n');

console.log('üéØ When to Use:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ An object needs to notify other objects without knowing who they are');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You need to implement event handling systems');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You want to implement publish-subscribe mechanisms');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You need to maintain consistency between related objects');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You\'re building reactive or event-driven applications\n');

console.log('üö´ When to Avoid:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ The subject has very few or no observers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ The notification order is critical and must be guaranteed');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You need to avoid the overhead of maintaining observer lists');
console.log('‚Ä¢ The relationship between subject and observers is very simple');
console.log('‚Ä¢ You\'re dealing with high-frequency updates that could cause performance issues\n');

console.log('üåç Real-World Examples:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Stock Market Systems - Stock prices notify traders and portfolio managers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ User Interface Frameworks - Model changes notify views to update');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Logging Systems - Application events notify various loggers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Social Media Feeds - User posts notify followers');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Game Engines - Game state changes notify UI components and AI systems\n');

console.log('üî¨ Testing Tips:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use mock observers to verify notification behavior');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Test unsubscribe functionality to prevent memory leaks');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Verify observer order if it matters for your use case');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Test error handling when observers throw exceptions');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use integration tests for complex observer interactions\n');

console.log('‚ö° Performance Notes:');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Observer lists should use efficient data structures (Set/Map)');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Consider batching notifications for high-frequency updates');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Use weak references for observers that might be garbage collected');
console.log('‚Ä¢ Profile memory usage with large numbers of observers');
