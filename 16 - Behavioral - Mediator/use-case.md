# Mediator Pattern Use Cases

## Overview

The Mediator pattern is essential for managing complex interactions between multiple objects while maintaining loose coupling. It's particularly valuable in systems where objects need to communicate but shouldn't have direct dependencies on each other, making it ideal for event-driven architectures and complex coordination scenarios.

## Use Case 1: Air Traffic Control System

### Problem
An air traffic control system needs to coordinate communication between multiple aircraft, ground control, weather systems, and runway management without creating tight coupling between these components.

### Solution
Implement a central air traffic control mediator that manages all communications, coordinates flight paths, handles weather alerts, and manages runway assignments.

**Target Interface**: `AirTrafficMediator` with flight coordination and communication routing  
**Key Features**: 
- Flight path coordination and conflict resolution
- Weather alert distribution to affected aircraft
- Runway assignment and scheduling
- Emergency situation handling and priority management
- Real-time communication routing between all system components
- Flight status tracking and updates

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:airtraffic`

## Use Case 2: Chat Application

### Problem
A chat application needs to manage message routing between users, handle user presence, manage rooms/channels, and coordinate notifications without direct user-to-user communication.

### Solution
Create a chat mediator that handles message routing, user management, room coordination, and notification distribution.

**Target Interface**: `ChatMediator` with message routing and user management  
**Key Features**: 
- Message routing to appropriate recipients (users, rooms, channels)
- User presence management and status updates
- Room/channel creation and management
- Notification system for mentions, direct messages, and system alerts
- Message history and search coordination
- User authentication and permission management

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:chat`

## Use Case 3: Smart Home Automation

### Problem
A smart home system needs to coordinate interactions between various devices (lights, thermostats, security cameras, door locks) based on events, schedules, and user preferences without devices directly communicating with each other.

### Solution
Implement a home automation mediator that manages device interactions, schedules, and event responses.

**Target Interface**: `HomeAutomationMediator` with device coordination and automation rules  
**Key Features**: 
- Device state management and coordination
- Automation rule execution and scheduling
- Event-driven responses (motion detection, time-based actions)
- Energy optimization and conflict resolution
- Security system integration and alert management
- User preference management and scene coordination

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:smarthome`

## Use Case 4: E-commerce Order Processing

### Problem
An e-commerce system needs to coordinate order processing across multiple services (inventory, payment, shipping, notification) without creating tight coupling between these services.

### Solution
Create an order processing mediator that manages the entire order lifecycle and coordinates between all services.

**Target Interface**: `OrderProcessingMediator` with service coordination and workflow management  
**Key Features**: 
- Order workflow management and state tracking
- Service coordination (inventory, payment, shipping, notifications)
- Error handling and rollback mechanisms
- Order status updates and customer notifications
- Inventory reservation and release management
- Payment processing and refund coordination

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:ecommerce`

## Use Case 5: Game Engine Component System

### Problem
A game engine needs to manage interactions between game objects, physics, rendering, audio, and input systems without creating complex interdependencies between these systems.

### Solution
Implement a game engine mediator that coordinates all system interactions and manages the game loop.

**Target Interface**: `GameEngineMediator` with system coordination and game loop management  
**Key Features**: 
- Game loop coordination and timing management
- System interaction routing (physics, rendering, audio, input)
- Event handling and propagation between systems
- Resource management and loading coordination
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Scene management and object lifecycle coordination

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:gameengine`

## Use Case 6: Car System Running State Coordination

### Problem
A modern car system must coordinate the running state of the vehicle based on the state and input of multiple components (ignition, gear, accelerator, brake). Direct dependencies between these components would make the system fragile, hard to maintain, and error-prone, especially as safety and operational rules become more complex.

### Solution
Implement a `CarRunningMediator` that acts as the central coordinator for all running-state-related interactions. The mediator enforces safety rules (e.g., cannot start unless in Park, cannot accelerate with brake pressed, cannot shift to Reverse while moving) and manages the car's state transitions based on component events.

**Target Interface**: `CarRunningMediator` with car state coordination and safety enforcement  
**Key Features**:
- Centralized coordination of ignition, gear, accelerator, and brake
- Enforces safety rules (e.g., start only in Park, block acceleration with brake, block shifting to Reverse while moving)
- State management for running, speed, and gear
- Event-driven updates and feedback to components
- Prevents invalid or unsafe transitions
- Extensible for additional car components (e.g., sensors, autopilot)

**Demo**: `npm run mediator:car-system`

## Best Practices

- **Keep Mediator Focused**: Avoid making the mediator a "god object" - focus on coordination only
- **Use Events Wisely**: Implement event-driven communication for loose coupling
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Centralize error handling in the mediator
- **Maintain State Carefully**: Use the mediator to manage shared state when necessary
- **Test Interactions**: Mock the mediator to test individual components in isolation

## Anti-Patterns

- **God Object**: Making the mediator responsible for too many concerns
- **Tight Coupling**: Colleagues becoming too dependent on mediator interface
- **Performance Bottleneck**: All communication going through a single point
- **Event Explosion**: Too many events making the system hard to understand
- **Over-Engineering**: Using mediator for simple, direct interactions
